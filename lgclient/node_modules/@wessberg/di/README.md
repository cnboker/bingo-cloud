# `@wessberg/di`

> A compile-time powered Dependency-Injection container for Typescript that holds services and can produce instances of them as required.

## Description

This is a tiny library that brings Dependency-Injection to Typescript. There are several competing libraries out there, but this one is unique in the sense
that:

- It is _seriously_ small.
- It does its work on compile-time. The only runtime dependency is the `DIContainer` itself.
- It doesn't ask you to reflect metadata or to annotate your classes with decorators. _"It just works"_.
- It maps interfaces to implementations. Most popular dependency injection systems for TypeScript doesn't do this. This allows you to truly decouple an abstraction from its implementation.
- It supports the .NET generic reflection flavour: `registerSingleton<Interface, Implementation>()`. No need for anything else.

This library provides constructor-based dependency injection. This means that your classes will receive dependency-injected services as arguments to their constructors.

This library is a runtime dependency, but you need to transform your code with the [`DI Custom Transformer`](https://github.com/wessberg/di-compiler) as part of your Typescript compilation step to make the reflection work.

## Install

### NPM

```
$ npm install @wessberg/di
```

### Yarn

```
$ yarn add @wessberg/di
```

## Usage

This library is meant to be super straightforward, super simple to use.
The following examples hopefully shows that:

### Registering services

To register services, simply instantiate a new service container and add services to it.
Here's several examples of how you may do that:

```typescript
import {DIContainer} from "@wessberg/di";

// Instantiate a new container for services
const container = new DIContainer();

// Register the service as a Singleton. Whenever the 'IMyService' service is requested,
// the same instance of MyService will be injected
DIContainer.registerSingleton<IMyService, MyService>();

// Register the service as a Transient. Whenever the 'IMyService' service is requested,
// a new instance of MyService will be injected
DIContainer.registerTransient<IMyOtherService, MyOtherService>();

// Rather than mapping a class to an interface,
// here we provide a function that returns an object that implements
// the required interface
DIContainer.registerSingleton<IAppConfig>(() => myAppConfig);

// You don't have to map an interface to an implementation.
DIContainer.registerSingleton<MyAwesomeService>();
```

### Retrieving instances of services

#### Injecting instances of services into classes

...Works completely automatically. As long as your class is constructed via
a `DIContainer`, and as long as the services it depends on are registered,
the class will receive the services as arguments to its' constructor:

```typescript
class MyClass {
  constructor(
    private myService: IMyService,
    private myOtherService: IMyOtherService,
    private myAwesomeService: MyAwesomeService
  ) {}
}
```

The true power of this library in comparison to others is that all of this mapping happens on compile-time.
This is what enables you to depend on interfaces, rather than objects that live on runtime.

#### Getting instances directly from the `DIContainer`

Sure, you can do that if you want to:

```typescript
// Gets a concrete instance of 'IMyService'. The implementation will
// depend on what you provided when you registered the service
const service = container.get<IMyService>();
```

## FAQ

#### This is pure magic. How does it work?

It may look like it, but I assure you it is quite simple. [Read this answer for an explanation](https://github.com/wessberg/di-compiler#how-does-it-work-exactly).

#### Is it possible to have multiple, scoped containers?

Sure. You can instantiate as many as you want to, as long as you make sure the [Custom Transformer for DI](https://github.com/wessberg/di-compiler) get's to see the files that contain them.
